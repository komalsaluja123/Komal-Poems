Hello will you come with me? and Nature Nature and Sleep

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
against the evils around me,
that haunt me day and night.

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
with the evils within me
which haunt others day and night.

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
with the desires within me
which will cause suffering for a lifetime.

Nature Nature a girl was calling out
but is there a nature? she was having doubt.

Nature Nature a boy was calling out
but is there a nature? he was having doubt.

Over the stars  above the moon
I'll go with a rocket soon
as it's time to go to bed
with a pillow and my head.

My mom says from doorways
before you go to bed please pray
and also sweep your room
and brush your teeth for a healthy next day
